# Atlas Migrations Directory

This directory contains versioned database migration files generated by Atlas.

## Migration File Naming Convention

Atlas uses the following naming convention:
- `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql` (e.g., `20240115143022_create_users_table.sql`)

## Important Notes

- Do not manually edit migration files after they have been applied
- Use `make atlas-new` to create new migrations
- Use `make atlas-diff` to generate migrations from schema changes
- Migration files are tracked in version control
